# bash-scripting
A collection of practical Bash scripts I’ve written to automate everyday tasks and simplify workflows.  Each script performs a specific task and also explains concepts of bash scripting in a subtle manner. Think of this repo as a toolbox: grab what you need, learn from the examples, and adapt them to your own projects.
